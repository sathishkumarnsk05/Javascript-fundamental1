// What is value
/* 
    - A value is a piece of data, such as eg: "sathish" 
    - A value is a smallest unit of information
    - To use the value in your code, save it in a variable.
*/

// What is variales
/*
    - Variable is like a container that holds the value.
    - The container contains a label.
    - The label allow us to use that container repeatedly in our code
    - Variables have the following types [Var, Let, Const]
    - There are several naming conventions in variable declarations. ["camelCase", "_", "$"]
    - Some conditions for declaring a variable are as follows: [1. Not start with a number and reserved key word like "New, function"]
*/
// Data type
/*
    - There are two types available in js: 1)Primitives, and 2) Objects
    * Primitives: [ 1)Number, 2)String, 3)Boolean, 4)Null, 5)Undefined, 6)Symbols and 7)BigInt]
    * Object: The object data type can contain both built-in objects, and user defined objects
    * Built-in object types can be: objects, arrays, dates, maps, sets, intarrays, floatarrays, promises, and more.
    `
        1) Number
        * Numbers always have Floating point numbers 1)Decimals and integers.
        Eg: let number = 20 it consider as let number = 20.0
        2) String
        * Sequence of characters used for text. always string with in the "" or '' quotes.
        Eg: let name = "javascript"
        3) Boolean
        * Logical type that can be true or false. using for taking dicisions.
        Eg: let logic = true or false
        4) Undefined
        * Value taken by the variable that is not yet defined (empty value)
        Eg: let a; consol.log(a) => OutPut: Undefined.
        5) Null
        * Also means as 'empty value'
        6) Symbol: Value that is unique and connot be changed
